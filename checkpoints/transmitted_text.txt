parliament president were permitted to express approval he would have done so now ', '<START> joseph conrad once observed being a woman is a terribly difficult task since it consists principally in dealing with men ', '<START> given this situation we do not even have a moral right to hold back croatia s access to the union ', '<START> however it is also right that we expect those beneficiary

the european union s information society capabilities in a very fast evolving world ', '<START> a recommendation from a committee is something the house must treat seriously but it is not an amendment to a proposal ', '<START> under these conditions the directive is counterproductive and should therefore not be adopted  this proposal should be rejected on thursday ', '<START> finally having explained this i am at your disposal in case there is any other explanation to be given in writing ', '<START> the committee on agriculture and rural development simply asks in this report that the

necessary steps to protect the financial and legal interests of the community ', '<START>  i do not have a list of those countries  this must be followed up in a careful manner ', '<START> since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed questions nos to will be reply to in writing ', '<START> the commission has already enhanced the prevention of diseases including cancer in the

president purgatory is just as painful as hell but you do not stay there permanently i am told ', '<START> will the commission now reopen its investigations into soc before it becomes fully

am afraid mrs wallstrom seems to be paying more attention to mr baron crespo than to you mr fatuzzo ', '<START> however this report is about raising justice and home affairs up to community level  i cannot support this ', '<START> i think actually that it is the bureau that can decide to refer the matter to the rules committee ', '<START> adopting amendment should not make amendment fall because

of depth and substance by contrast with similar documents drawn up by our allies ', '<START> we demand however that each member state should have effective control of the eu s external borders and

sahara conflict ', '<START> on this issue and this report i feel entitled to emphasise an idea that i have put forward on several occasions ', '<START> as regards the idea of establishing european level quality indicators defining the notion of adequate housing we need to aim high ', '<START> defining a concept as vague as innovation and describing the contribution made by innovation to

very reasonable criterion but is it written down in any rules or in the rules of procedure of the plenary or of parliament ', '<START> to conclude mr president i should like to say that we expect

on his patience and tenacity in taking this forward ', '<START> i am delighted with this agreement which should in particular prevent abuses of a dominant position and facilitate the balanced development of the european airport sector ', '<START> the next item is the statement by the president in office of the council on the programme of the german presidency and the situation in kosovo ', '<START> overall though commissioner i believe we are on the eve of reform as you made clear and the estimates would then have to be clear ', '<START> the response of the public authorities has been to refuse to submit to the institutions with the resulting risk danger and lack of political concern ', '<START> similarly on the budget line erdf operational technical assistance for the european regional development fund the first two new paragraphs should be replaced by the following', '<START> i ask the sittings service to make the necessary corrections in the minutes if the plenary will

said that we shall be taking a decision next week  that is swift work for the commission !', '<START> the issue here is not scaremongering but resolving perfectly ordinary difficulties and we hope our questions will encourage the commission to do so ', '<START> as commissioner damanaki said ultimately the only solution may in fact be for us to become independent of coal as quickly as possible ',

shall therefore vote now on recital b as amended by mr tannock ', '<START> pl mr president i would like to refer to the situation of national minorities in lithuania where their rights are continually being reduced ', '<START> now with your permission we are going to continue the sitting because otherwise we will be here all night discussing the same thing ', '<START> if however this is merely an argument about procedure the vote in favour of amendment did not necessarily imply that amendment had lapsed ', '<START> rapporteur  even after the vote there is no reason to start the debate again  we are now in favour of voting ', '<START> the key to an enlarged union s ability to act is the willingness to accept majority decisions in as many areas as possible ', '<START> the next item is the

should remind you that mr barroso is the president of the commission not of the european parliament ', '<START> de mr president unfortunately today s vote on parliament s resolution on turkey is overshadowed by very distressing and worrying events ', '<START> in the final analysis the key question is are we talking about spreading eu values or diminishing their sphere of influence ', '<START> speaking entirely personally and not on behalf of my party or my group a lot clearly still needs to be done ', '<START> moreover the introduction of an independent authority is going to make it possible to resolve any conflicts between the partners objectively ', '<START> the issues just mentioned point to the urgent need for the entry into force of a european charter of fundamental rights ', '<START> my question is not the same because i put it in a european key and with an extremely constructive intention ', '<START> b moved by mrs poisson on behalf of the committee on agriculture and

pl madam president commissioner mr stockmann deserves our gratitude  this is indeed a good compromise  i congratulate him ', '<START> i should point out that some of our colleagues are currently in sierra leone to monitor the elections there ', '<START> i therefore urge you to apply rule of the rules of procedure and also allow a vote on amendment ', '<START> fr mr president i perfectly understand the argument stated by the rapporteur leading us to vote firstly on amendment ', '<START> civilian democratic control over the military in line with practice in eu member states is still to be ensured ', '<START> like you i am persuaded that we should continue our efforts to dismantle tax barriers in the internal market ', '<START> thirdly we want to and have to make progress on the enlargement of the eu as quickly as possible ', '<START> you said that if there is no agreement next week the commission will adopt a decision and position ', '<START> i hope that i have made some responsible proposals and i look forward to the commissioner s reply ', '<START> finally i should like to congratulate mr baldarelli on his report which gains my group s full support ', '<START> the next item is the council and commission statements on oil exploration and extraction risks liability and regulation ', '<START> fr i have one brief remark mr president which i should like to be recorded in the minutes ', '<START> the beneficiaries of these new rules should ultimately be air transport users and i am delighted about that ', '<START> ladies and gentlemen i will stop there

component of sustainable development which means including it in the wto negotiations ', '<START> therefore in my contention amendment no is something that should be rejected  we should discuss

free trade area for the entire american continent ', '<START> i also hope that in accordance with paragraph of the resolution council will ensure an improvement in legal cooperation in all member countries ', '<START> intergovernmentalism and lack of transparency is not the way to convince european citizens of our determination to win the war against organized crime ', '<START> madam president

like to express my approval and full support for this oral amendment ', '<START> secondly so far there has been no damage within the reserve and the damage caused to the ecosystem is not yet
